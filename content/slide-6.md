# Part 1: Setup, Getting Started and Querying

## String operators - concatenation

The string concatenation operator allows you to combine multiple string values into one.

In the example on the right we combine peoples first and last names into a full name.

Try adding the field "title" to the output as well.

<pre id="example">
SELECT fname || " " || lname AS full_name
    FROM contacts 
</pre>
