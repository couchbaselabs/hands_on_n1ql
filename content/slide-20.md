## DML 

N1QL provides DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE, and UPSERT statements. These statements allow you to create, delete, and modify the data stored in JSON documents by specifying and executing simple commands.

<pre id="example">
INSERT INTO contacts (KEY, VALUE) 
  VALUES ("baldwin", {"name":"Alex Baldwin", "type":"contact"})
</pre>
